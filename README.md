Guide for Logic Analyzer RPi
==============

Logic Analyzer RPi is a program to use your Raspberry Pi as a Logic Analyzer. It allows you to capture logic states at the GPIO pins (using pull up then pull down resistors of the GPIO). The logic states of the GPIO can be measured up to few kHz, with a very large number of points. The captured data can be saved to or loaded from a file. Decoding can be performed according to specified protocol and results can be ploted in a PNG file.

This program has been made to make the implementation of new protocols as easy as possible.

I)Example of output 
==============
![logic states](https://github.com/superzerg/NMC9314_pi/blob/master/read.png)
Image obtained during two consecutive read instructions on a NMC9314 EEPROM memory using following command (loading read.dat capture file):

	logic_analyzer -l examples/test.dat -d microwire -p examples/test2.png


II) Dependence 
==============
It use the C library for Raspberry Pi [http://www.open.com.au/mikem/bcm2835](http://www.open.com.au/mikem/bcm2835/index.html)

III) Disclaimer
===============
This program has been made for personal use, it works for me, but I offer no warranty as this program may (unlikely) damage your raspberry pi, your memory and/or any electronic device connected. Use it at your own risk.

IV) Connection
===============

If you have to make measurement on a 5V circuit, this is a way to avoid toasting your GPIO.

On a 3V3 circuit you can connect direclty your input to the GPIO pin.
As the GPIO pins number orderring is at least confusing, you can print the following image corrsponding to your RPi version (let your mouse on an image to see the version). 
Then apply it on GPIO pins (from http://www.doctormonk.com/2013/02/raspberry-pi-and-breadboard-raspberry.html).
PDF files are also availble there for easier printing.

The numbers next to the GPIO pins used to acquire data are the one to use in [pins](http://superzerg.github.com/logic-analyzer/classlogic__input.html#a691df164430ee863f12e0aaaeb7510a7) array.
The order matters, for exemple with the microwire protocol:
- pins[0] acquires CS (Chip Select) of the studied device.
- pins[1] acquires CLK (clock) of the studied device.
- pins[2] acquires MOSI (Master Out Slave In) of the studied device.
- pins[3] acquires MISO (Master In Slave Out) of the studied device.

V) Install
===============
 1. install:
 - the C library for Raspberry Pi (http://www.open.com.au/mikem/bcm2835/index.html)
 - mgl library:

   from repos (does not seems to work anymore):
   
	sudo apt-get install libmgl-dev
   
   from source (version 1.16 is confirmed to work):
   
   	svn checkout https://svn.code.sf.net/p/mathgl/code/ mathgl-code
	
	cd mathgl-code/mathgl-1x
	
	./configure
	
	make
	
	sudo make install
	
	sudo ln -s /usr/local/lib/libmgl.so.5 /usr/lib/
	
- automake:

	sudo apt-get install automake
	
- doxygen:
	
	sudo apt-get install doxygen
	
- texinfo
	
	sudo apt-get install texinfo
	
 2. get the Logic Analyzer RPi files at https://github.com/superzerg/logic-analyzer
 	
	git clone https://github.com/superzerg/logic-analyzer.git
	
	cd logic-analyzer
	
 3. compile with:
 
 	aclocal
 
 	automake --add-missing
	
	automake
	
	autoconf
 
	./configure
	
	make
	
	optional:
	
	sudo make install
	
  It seems v2 of the mgl library in raspbian repositories does not contain v1 files by default. if during compilation you got errors cause of missing headers in mgl/ remove the package libmgl-dev with "apt-get remove libmgl-dev" and follow the install mgl library from source procedure.

	
 4. test the program works correctly (no capture yet, just loading a file).
 
    logic_analyzer -l examples/test.dat -d microwire -p examples/test2.png

VI) Usage
===============

    ./logic_analyzer [-h] [-v level] [-w sec] [-l file | -c pins [-i ms] [-n npoint]] [-d protocol] [-s file] [-p file]
program displaying GPIO states over time and decoding protocols if supported. Protocols supported are :

- microwire: tested with an NMC9314 EEPROM.
- raw: no decoding is performed, but the logic state evolution is shown.
    
program parameters are:

- -h|--help : this help.
- -l|--load file : Use data in binary file as captured data.
- -c|--capture pins: pins to use durring the capture. Must be the GPIO numbers separated by \',\' or \' \'. Space may be used if le string pins is protected by \"\". ex 14,15,27,4 or \"14 15 27 4\". Order may be inportant if --decode is used depending on the protocol.
- -i|--interval ms: interval in ms between 2 captures (default is 0.5 ms wich is the recomended minimum). For low intervals (ms<10), the interval can be sometime higher if the RPi is busy durring capture.
- -n|--npoint npoint: number of data point to capture (default 2000).
- -d|--decode protocol: decode the captured data using the specified protocol. Some protocols may need a special order for the pins given to the --capture option.
- -s|--save file : save captured data to binary file.
- -p|--plot file : plot captured data to PNG file.
- -w|--wait sec : time in second to wait before the capture.
- -v|--verbose level: set the verbosity to level (0 to 4, higher means more messages,default is 3).
